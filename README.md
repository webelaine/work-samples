# Elaine's work samples

Thank you for your interest in my work! I've tried to include a variety of projects but am happy to discuss others as I have a broad range of experience. Several of these code samples correspond to visual portfolio samples included on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elainershannon/).

## Sample 1: Fish Rules API integration

Eight fishery management councils manage fishing regulations in the U.S. Until recently, they managed multiple copies of those regulations: one copy in a service called Fish Rules, which displays regulations to the public through their website and app, and other copies on their individual council websites - often on several different URLs. I wrote a WordPress plugin which connects to the Fish Rules API using their individual API credentials, pulls the information nightly, and displays that information in various formats throughout the website. Now each council who uses this plugin can manage the data in a single location - the Fish Rules service - and trust that the data will propagate wherever it is needed.

## Sample 2: WordPress theme

The St. Mary's University custom theme has gone through a number of iterations. The latest version was built to pair well with the Block Editor and uses custom blocks, such as Bordered Boxes that let editors select FontAwesome icons to highlight key details. The parent theme is used on several sites, and child themes hone details for sites such as law and alumni.

Special attention was devoted to pages such as academic program pages, which showcase a major, minor, or degree program and are key to students determining whether the University is a good fit. Block patterns help standardize common information sets, while the custom blocks and block styles empower editors to add visual flair while knowing their choices will fit within brand guidelines.

See the theme live:
* [St. Mary's flagship site](https://www.stmarytx.edu/) (parent theme)
* [St. Mary's law](https://law.stmarytx.edu/) (parent theme)
* [St. Mary's alumni](https://alumni.stmarytx.edu/) (child theme)
* [Policy Library](https://www.stmarytx.edu/policies/) (child theme)

## Sample 3: Gutenberg blocks

A variety of custom blocks, and Core block variations, was created for St. Mary's so they could discontinue the use of separate landing page platforms and empower content editors to create more visually appealing layouts right on the main website. A [Finder block](https://www.stmarytx.edu/campuslife/living-on-campus/#residence-hall-finder) on the flagship site helps prospective students search for residence halls that meet their needs and budget. A custom Related Posts block visually displays [stories](https://www.stmarytx.edu/academics/programs/english/#related-stories) and [faculty](https://www.stmarytx.edu/academics/programs/english/#faculty) from academic program pages to related alumni magazine articles and professor bios.
